# Requirements

We need to conduct research in order to better understand the **requirements** of the users, and what they will eventually need your new design to do.

## Environmental Requirements

or the context of use for your system:

What's the physical environment like?

What's the social environment like? would using your system inconvenience or confuse others?

What is the organizational environment?

How easy is tech support to obtain?

Are there stakeholders who control or influence your users?

## Functional Requirements

or what your system needs to be able to do:

What is your system doing in general terms?

what are the specific capabilities that the above requires?

how will your system support them?

## Technical requirements

or how your system needs to be built:

are there constraints to the technologies you can use (modality, emissions, battery life, etc.)

Price, size, weight, etc.

Compatibility and integration with other technologies

data storage requirements

## Usability requirements

or how easy to use should your system be:

ease of learning: iPhone vs. Boeing cockpit

ease of use

protection from, and recovery from "errors"
