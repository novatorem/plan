# Requirements

We need to conduct research in order to better understand the **requirements** of the users, and what they will eventually need your new design to do.

## Environmental Requirements

The context of use for your system.

- What's the physical environment like?
- What's the social environment like?
  - Would using your system inconvenience or confuse others?
- What is the organizational environment?
- How easy is it to obtain tech support??
- Are there stakeholders who control or influence your users?

## Functional Requirements

What your system needs to be able to do.

- What is your system doing in general terms?
- What are the specific capabilities that the above requires?
- How will your system support them?

## Technical requirements

How your system needs to be build.

- Are there constraints to the technologies you can use (modality, emissions, battery life, etc.)?
- What would the price, size, weight, and other factors be?
- Will there be any compatibility or integration with other technologies
- Will it require storage or processing?

## Usability requirements

How easy to use will the system be?

- What's the level of complexity?
  - iPhone vs. Boeing cockpit
- How easy will it be to use?
- How will it protect and recover from errors, issues, or bugs?
