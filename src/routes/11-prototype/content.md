# Prototype

## Prototype Fidelity

Fidelity: how faithful is the prototype to the final system's look and feel?

**low fidelity:**

- does not resemble final product, operation slower
- faster to create and iterate
- obviously low-investment, encourages experimentation

**high fidelity:**

- looks and operates like real product
- more accurate: comments related to final design
- false sense of completeness and focus on details

## Prototype Technologies

from _early_ to _late_:

- paper: nothing is automated
- presentation software: choose-your-own-next-screenf
- dedicated prototyping tools (variable)
- HTML/CSS/JS: interactive links but no "guts"
- final system platform/technology: interaction + guts

## Prototyping Functionality

**Question:** How do you prototype a system that has not actually been implemented yet?

**Answer:** _The Wizard of Oz_

## Prototyping: Breadth vs. Depth

- **Breadth:** demonstrates the amount of features, options and commands. Each feature is rendered, but cannot be followed very far.
- **Depth:** shows interactivity and functionality. All but a few critical features are inactive "dead ends".
- "horizontal prototypes (favors features)" vs. "vertical prototypes (favors functionalities)"

## Prototyping Scenarios

It is expected that not every interaction or path will be explored in every prototype.

Constrain user interaction and the prototype implementation to yield the type of feedback that would be most useful.

Why/what are you prototyping?

- proof of concept
- visual design, screen layout, information display.
- form & physical attributes
- interaction, workflow, tasks
- functional model
- difficult, controversial, critical areas

## Paper prototyping

- paper is cheap, easy and universally understood
- paper is instantly customizable, malleable, and unconstraining
- encourages creativity

## Conceptual model

A **conceptual model** is "a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates"

Designers has a conceptual model for their system, what it's supposed to do, how it works, etc.

It enables "designer to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets"

Forming a conceptual model for your system is an essential step in designing for it.

A designer's conceptual model is structured, logical and consistent. They know everything about their system and how it is supposed to work.

Users form their own models which are based solely on interacting with the system.

Users' models are ad hoc, informal and incomplete.

Sometimes they're incoherent, illogical, emotional, even superstitious (fear of upgrades).
