- **Objective**: observed facts, statistical evidence, impartial
- **Subjective**: opinions, intuition, bias

Evaluation Methods:

- **Sample survey**: obtain a representative sample of a population in order to understand population-wide trends and preferences
- **Laboratory experiment**: perform fine measurements of user performance in tightly controlled laboratory conditions
- **Field study**: understand underlying user needs in the wild by observing them in their environment
  - **Naturalistic observation**: no involvement, observation only
  - **Questionnaires**: wide distribution, many responses
  - **Interviews**: great detail, adapt to responses
  - **Focus groups and workshops**: multiple participants, consensus
  - **Studying documentation**: existing process/system
  - **Diaries/logging**: details on duration of usage and performance
