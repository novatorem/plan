An **experience map** is a tool to help you situate your eventual design for your particular tasks, users, and use cases.

## Experience Model

The following outlines the steps to follow for a well rounded user experience.

**Entice:** attract, build anticipation, and set expectations  
**Enter:** guide and orient into the experience  
**Engage:** ritual artifact engages senses and maintain connection  
**Exit:** guided to a new, transformed state  
**Extend:** reminders keep you connected to experience

## Experience Map

The experience map is a tool for designers to understand the overall experience and to identify:

- **Bright spots**: Where does the experience offer delight or work exceptionally well?
- **Hot spots**: Where does the experience break down and fail users?
- **Gaps**: Where is there no support for the user's experience?
