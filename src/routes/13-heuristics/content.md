# Heuristic

A heuristic is an experience-based "rule of thumb" that helps find a workable, but not necessarily perfect or proven, solution to a problem at hand. In interface design, it is one of a set of well-established usability principles experts are familiar with.

**Heuristic Evaluation**: a technique for identifying usability issues in which experts review new interfaces and judge them based on their compliance with a set of heuristics

## Nielsen's Heuristics (1994)

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

These can be summarized into the four C's:

1. **Control**: user is in control of the system at all times
2. **Conveyance**: where to go, what to do?
3. **Continuity**: similar results from similar actions
4. **Context**: clear and efficient presentation of information

## C.R.A.P. Design Principles

- **Contrast**: Difference that makes a difference.
- **Repetition**: Consistent branding, learning something once is useful on multiple occasions.
- **Alignment**: All elements should be visually connected to other elements in the interface.
- **Proximity** (also Balance): Put similar things close together. Put controls and objects close together.
