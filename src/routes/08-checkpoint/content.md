# Checkpoint

Let's take a breather and try to to create a SFCB following design principles.

## Short Form Creative Brief

The SFCB is a very short, constantly evolving document to ensure focus on the problem.

1. Objective (2-3 sentences)
2. Key personas (1-2 personas)
3. Key scenarios (3-4 scenarios)
4. Key design principles

## Design principles

Set of commandments or general principles that express your high-level vision for the system.

They should be brief, memorable, and specific. They should apply across your entire system, differentiate you from your competitors, and they should not conflict with each other.
