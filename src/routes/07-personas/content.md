# Personas

A **persona** is a hypothetical user archetype used throughout the design process.

Personas are not users, rather they are amalgamations of user goals, motivations and behaviours seen in data from real people.

The persona will include a description not only of the goals, but also of the characteristics of the user archetype: skills, attitudes, etc.

**Primary personas** are used to define the most common types of users.

## Persona elements

Group (e.g., airline passengers)

Fictional name

Job titles/responsibilities

Demographics: age, education, ethnicity, family status

Goals and tasks

Physical, social and technological environment

A quote that sums up what matters most to them about the product

## Primary persona

Demonstrates key goals and behaviour patterns.

If the design fails for a primary persona, the product will fail.

Each primary persona may require a different interface.

**Example:** a family electronic calendar.

Possible primary personas:

- Nancy, a career mom
- Stephen, a stay-at-home dad
- Slash, a forgetful teenager

## Creating personas

A persona acts as a character to designers and is written to encompass a salient range of details while helping designers relate to their user base.

Alliterating persona names with their main titles will help you talk about them:

Manager Molly, Slacker Steve, Tech Support Terrence...

## Families/Groups of Personas

A group of primary personas is useful if/when (mostly when) the range of your users cannot be represented by a single primary persona. E.g., univeristy students:

- Affulent Alice
- Commuter Kyle
- International Ingrid
- Mature Morris
- Poor Peter
- Limited means Larry

## Scenarios

Narrative is a powerful design tool.

A **scenario** is an informal narrative description of users or personas using artifacts within environments to carry out tasks and activities.

Scenarios focus on the current state of users' activities and exclude the proposed system.

Scenarios have all the elements of narratives: characters, conflict, plot, resolution.
