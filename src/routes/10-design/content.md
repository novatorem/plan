# Design

Early design <-> Late design <-> Development

Low fidelity <-> High fidelity

## Wireframes

A **wireframe** is a low-fidelity visual schematic that represents the skeletal framework of a webpage or digital interface.

Wireframes are unconcerned with visual qualities, only with conveying relative placement, functionality and role of components.

They are used within a design team, by programmers and implementers of the system as **blueprints** for the layout of an interface.

Wireframes are generally **static** and non-interactive.

## Mockups

A **mockup** is a high-fidelity rendering of the visual elements of a system: colours, typefaces, etc.

Mockups are relatively expensive and invite discussions of the visual and aesthetic qualities of the design.

They solicit fine-grained, detail-oriented feedback and should be used to fine-tune a design in the latter stages once more significant design and interaction issues have been resolved.

Like wireframes, mockups are **static** and **non-interactive**.

## Prototypes

A **prototype** is "a sample of a part or product fabricated in advance of production to allow demonstration, evaluation, or testing of the product."

_proto_ (first, initial) + _typos_ (image, impression)

We use prototypes to illustrate and evaluate our products and systems with end users, usability experts and team members.

Prototypes of digital systems are **interactive**, i.e., they demonstrate how the system would react to user actions.
