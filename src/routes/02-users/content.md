# User-centered design

We'll be focused on attempting to get user feedback throughout the process.

| Stage    | Methods                                                                                                                        |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Needs    | User profiles, needs, scenarios, task analysis, environment, technology, work practices, business goals, competition, personas |
| Design   | Conceptual model, proposed scenarios, interaction process, interface, prototype, product                                       |
| Build    | Paper prototype, prototype, interface, alpha/beta, product                                                                     |
| Evaluate | Focus groups, usability tests, user surveys, experiments, heuristic evaluations, user observations                             |

## Users and Stakeholders

We'll also need to differentiate between target users and relevant stakeholders.

- **Users:** the individuals who will be interacting with your product
- **Stakeholders:** people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on system requirements

| Characteristic            | Trait                                                                             |

| Environmental             | sound levels, table height, software                                              |
| Perceptual abilities      | hearing, vision, heat sensitivity                                                 |
| Cognitive abilities       | memory span, reading level, tech skills                                           |
| Personality/social traits | likes, preferences, patience                                                      |
| Cultural traits           | language, symbols, dialog box flow                                                |

| Job/role characteristics  | mandatory vs discretionary use, level of training, turnover rate, task importance |

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

![Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/MaslowHierarchy.png/800px-MaslowHierarchy.png)

Understand what kind of need you are fulfilling for your users. Further, make sure your design does not threaten a lower-level need while solving a higher level one.
