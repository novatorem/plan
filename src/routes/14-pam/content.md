# Perception, Attention, Memory

## Perception

This is classified as the act of identifying, organizing and interpreting information about our environment we receive through the senses, typically to guide action. Occurs outside out conscious awareness and is virtually impossible to influence.

- **Bottom-up processing**: combining information from individual sensory cells into more complex representations of objects
- **Top-down processing**: previous knowledge, memory, expectations and attention

Let's talk about the human eye for a bit. The image is generally inverted, and corrected later.  
Humans have two types of photosensitive cells:

- Cones
  - Center of the image (fovea)
  - High resolution of detail
  - Perceives color
- Rods
  - Around the fovea
  - Luminance and contrast
  - Peripheral vision
  - Motion

We have two to provide stereoscopic vision, which combines input into one coherent whole and lets us estimate distance, as well as for redundancy.

This comes into play when it comes to **color**. The eye has receptors for (vaguely) three different colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). Blue being the least well perceived (only 4% of cones are blue receptors). Thus, humans can be afflicted by color blindness, which affects 9% of the population, preventing them from distinguishing certain colors.

To design for color blindness:

- Avoid salient red-green distinctions
- Use blue/yellow spectrum
- Use gray-scale

### Gestalt Principles of Perception

Objects are perceived in their entirety, not as collections of features (lines, shapes).  
Several Gestalt principles of grouping (objects are likelier to be perceived as part of a whole):

- Proximity
- Similarity (size, shape)
- Closure
- Common fate
- Good form
- Connectedness
- Common area
- Adaptation and Contrast

Perception has one higher purpose, which is to distinguish what is important/salient/about to eat you from what is not. To do so, our senses will adapt to ambient levels and perceive them as normal, while still being sensitive to changes. This can be seen in the "cocktail party effect," wherein you can tune out a multitude of conversations you are not a part of.

### Implications

- Text and visual elements should be legible and clearly contrast from the background
- Avoid over-reliance on color, especially when lighting conditions are sparse or unknown
- Avoid putting salient information far away from the foveal focus OR make it appropriately large
- Bordering, spacing and color are effective ways of grouping visual elements
- Sound cues should be audible and distinguishable

## Attention

Not all information perceived is important or needs to be attended to. Attention is a filter that allows us to select the important stimuli for the situation and to devote our resources to those while ignoring others.

Attentional resources are finite: if too much stimuli is present, crucial information will be missed. Generally, there is a single conscious focus of attention.

### Splitting attention

As is often the case, multiple stimuli must be attended to at the same time - this is what's considered as multi-tasking. In that case we often perform multiplexing: rapidly switching attention between tasks.

### Captured attention

We are mostly in control of what we attend to. However, sometimes external stimuli demand our attention. We reflexively focus on stimuli our brain perceives as urgently salient:

- Loud noises
- Bright lights or colors
- Unexpected movement

### Implication

- Make information salient when needed
- Make important information annoyingly hard to ignore
- Use techniques to direct the user's attention: color, ordering, spacing, underlining
- Avoid too much information because that taxes our attention
- Avoid using the same modality (visual, auditory, etc.) for two different tasks

## Memory
