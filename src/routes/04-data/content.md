# Data

## Setting goals

Why are we gathering data?

- Conduct two rounds of user research
  - First: goal will be to understand a problem space and to determine what issues your users are facing
  - Second: evaluating how well the new design works or would work to solve the issues discovered earlier

## Identifying participants

Who are we gathering data from?

- Everyone to whom your question applies belongs to your population
- Which members of your population will you study?
  - All (saturation sampling) - very rare
  - A random subset (random sampling)
  - A random subset in multiple categories (stratified sampling)
  - Whoever you can get your hands on (convenience sampling) - least rigorous, but we'll be using this

## Ethics

Are we doing any harm by gathering data?

- Respect for participants
- Do no harm
- Informed consent
  - Typically only adults 18+ are able to give consent
  - Elements:
    - Disclosure: experimenter explains the purposes of the study and the procedure truthfully
    - Capacity: the participant should be able to understand the study and form a reasonable judgment with the information provided
    - Voluntariness: free of coercion, manipulation, or bias, non-conditional compensation
  - Voluntary participation and right to withdraw
  - Right to privacy

## Triangulation

Employing different techniques to answer the same question

## Pilot testing

Trial runs of the main study

- Thoroughly test instruments before deploying the study on actual users
- Participant time is valuable to them, and their data is valuable to you
