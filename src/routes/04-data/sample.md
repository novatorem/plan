Our research has been narrowed down. Initially, it was financial literacy aimed at the entire province of Ontario (due to provincial financial laws, taxation, and debt control). We also did not target a specific group. Now, we will be targeting people aged between 20-25, preferably recent graduates, due to various similarities such as educational level, OSAP versioning, and familiarity with pre-existing technologies. Further, instead of targeting all of Ontario, we will now be looking into the Greater Toronto Area. This is due to the difference in daily expenses in a low population village or town versus a dense city or town with more options and higher expenses.
