# Memory

## Memory Capacity

Human immediate memory capacity is very limited
Number of stored objects is 7 Â± 2 regardless of the complexity of the objects
Binary digits, decimal digits, words, etc.
So rather than bits, working memory deals in chunks
Memory span varies wildly, notably for words: it was lower for longer words and for unfamiliar words

## Memory models

Working memory: central executive
Sub-units of central executive:
  Visuo-spatial sketchpad
  Phonological loop
  Episodic buffer
Central executive communicates with long-term memory

## Auditory Memory

Phonological loop is linear, single-channel and has a very limited storage duration (~2000ms)
Information stored there can be rehearsed but that captures the "inner monologue" and interferes with speech
production
There is some evidence that drivers encode information about cars behind them using declarative statements in
auditory memory

## Visuo-spatial Memory

Humans evolved to store spatial information in order to avoid obstacles and navigate a largely planar world
Spatial memory is extremely powerful:
  We recall dinner guests by mentally stepping around a table
  Memorizers can recall the precise order of a full 52-card deck by using the Method of Loci (i.e., the Memory
  Palace)

## Long-Term Memory

Not a faithful representation of stimuli, objects or events
What details are encoded depends on what is being attended to
When memories are retrieved, lots of details are filled in from expectations and previous experience
Every time a memory is retrieved, certain feature are reinforced while others decay
Not an addressable storage

## Memory Activation

LTM consists of connected nodes, each of which has an activation value: how easy it is to retrieve that node from
memory
3 factors influence activation:
  Practice: your name has a high activation because you've had to recall it thousands of times
  Recency: recently recalled or encoded memories are "fresher" are more easily accessible
  Context: nodes that were encoded at the same time or are related are connected in memory. When one has a high activation, the activations of those around it increase and vice versa

## Recognition vs. Recall

Recall: process of remembering without any additional cues or context
Recall-based interfaces such as command lines are taxing to the user because they require a hard memory search for
both commands (e.g., "copy") and data (e.g., filenames)
In contrast, recognition involves merely confirming that a memory node is the one you meant to access
Recognition is easier than recall because some of the activations of related concepts have been raised before you
were asked to make decisions

## Implications

Put all items on the screen and let the user recognize the one they want
Use menus and buttons to indicate what the user can do in any given situation
Use icons the user is familiar with that reference known metaphors
Do not expect the user to remember complex sequences of steps
Prime the user with past memories: provide task, file and search history
Enable the user to employ their own context-aiding strategies: spatial layout, tagging, colour-coding, etc.
