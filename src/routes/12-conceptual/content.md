# Conceptual models

A **conceptual model** is "a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates"

Designers have a conceptual model for their system, what it's supposed to do, and how it works. It enables "designer to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets"

Users form their own models which are based solely on interacting with the system. Their models are generally ad hoc, informal, and incomplete.

## Conceptual model components

A conceptual model is built from:

- **Affordances**: what things can do
- **Signifiers**: what things look like they can do
- **Constraints**: what things are made not to do
- **Mappings**: how things relate to user's prior knowledge
- **Metaphors**: how things relate to user's prior knowledge
- **Standards** and **norms**: how things should be
- **Instructions**: what users are told to do
- **Interactions**: what users learn by interacting with the system

## User models and game design

Games are structured, carefully designed interactive experiences.
