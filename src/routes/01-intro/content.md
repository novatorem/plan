# Introduction

Let's begin with some definitions to better understand what needs to be accomplished.

## Human-Computer Interaction

An interdisciplinary field focused on the **interactions** between human users and computer systems, including the user interface that seeks to create **effective, efficient, and satisfying interactions.**

## Interaction Design

- Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives
- Design of spaces for human communication & interaction

## User Experience

- Everything that the user sees, hears and touches
- The overall experience a user has with a product, service or event
- How satisfying, usable, and well-designed users perceive an interface to be

This is the phenomenon you should understand and strive to improve in order to succeed when designing interactions.

## Iteration and Evaluation

The user experience is a crucial driving force in interaction design.

User-Centered Design (UCD) involves testing with users at every stage of the design process.

- Needs and requirements
- Develop designs
- Build prototypes
- Evaluate designs
