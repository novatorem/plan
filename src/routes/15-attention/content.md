# Attention

Not all information perceived is important or needs to be attended to. Attention is a filter that allows us to select the important stimuli for the situation and to devote our resources to those while ignoring others.

Attentional resources are finite: if too much stimuli is present, crucial information will be missed. Generally, there is a single conscious focus of attention.

## Splitting attention

As is often the case, multiple stimuli must be attended to at the same time - this is what's considered as multi-tasking. In that case we often perform multiplexing: rapidly switching attention between tasks.

## Captured attention

We are mostly in control of what we attend to. However, sometimes external stimuli demand our attention. We reflexively focus on stimuli our brain perceives as urgently salient:

- Loud noises
- Bright lights or colors
- Unexpected movement

## Implication

- Make information salient when needed
- Make important information annoyingly hard to ignore
- Use techniques to direct the user's attention: color, ordering, spacing, underlining
- Avoid too much information because that taxes our attention
- Avoid using the same modality (visual, auditory, etc.) for two different tasks
